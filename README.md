# PasswordGen
*Password generator that, on click, prompts user for letter case, numbers, symbols, and length of password before generating a password based on user parameters

##Changes

*Creating the same functions for each value due to be randomized and trying to set-up how to run them repeatedly ended up being more complicated than necessary. Removed these functions and changed to cancat in order to combine strings and then run the randomizing function a single time over the final string.

*Having an issue where each new password generated is added to the tail of the previous. Still working on solution.
