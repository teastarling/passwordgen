# PasswordGen
*Password generator that, on click, prompts user for letter case, numbers, symbols, and length of password before generating a password based on user parameters

##Changes

*Cleaned up code a bit

*Established questions and variables for pop-ups on button "click"

*Attempting to change input for "length" question from a String to an integer. Getting back "number" for "type of" under "length," but then when attempting to console log number, getting "NaN" as a result
